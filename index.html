<h3 class="text-center">The Spinach King Of Khayelitsha</h3>
<h4 class="text-center">Healthy Living</h4>
<p class="text-center">Spinach, a desire to prove himself and a sincerely caring attitude have catapulted Lufefe Nomjana’s and his spinach-based bakery into a proud business that has started to supply a local chain store.
And, while Lufefe’s dream may be built on the realization that he has something more to offer his community and a passion to make a difference, it is pure hard work that has turned this young entrepreneur into a successful businessman.
He grew up in humble circumstances in the Eastern Cape and left school at age 17 to come to Cape Town to find work and help support his mother and little brothers.
“I was living on my own in a shack in <abbr title="Cape Town">CPT</abbr> and I somehow got pulled into a life of drinking and criminal activity. I was studying, but failed Grade 11. As a role model and team leader amongst my friends, I soon realized that I would have to change my ways if I wanted to escape my old life and be a success.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Khayelitsha Gin Business</h3>
<h4 class="text-center">Local Gin</h4>
<p class="text-center">Khayelitsha will soon have its own gin, says Luvuyo Jongile of Ilitha Park.
He says he has been working tirelessly for the past eight months and finally there is something he can show for it.
According to GroungUp, Jongile was inspired by a study that found that the French alcohol brand Hennessy Cognac was popular in Khayelitsha.
“I questioned myself asking, why does it have to be like that? Why can we not consume our own brands? After visiting a distillery in Woodstock, this is when the decision to make my own gin came about,” says Jongile.
Mayine Gin is named after Jongile’s son. Mayine means “let it rain”, which Jongile says refers to blessings upon success, hard work, and entrepreneurship which he hopes will rain on him and other black professionals who start something.
Jongile grew up playing tennis for the Western Province which he says kept him extremely busy.
"Growing up in Khayelitsha was a bit of a challenge, because I was robbed and my tennis equipment was taken,” he says.
He says he is a gin fan.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">CPT Water Crisis Eases</h3>
<h4 class="text-center">Desalition Barge Plan</h4>
<p class="text-center">Cape Town’s city council scrapped plans to hire a desalination barge to supplement water supply after good winter rains helped ease the worst drought on record.
The city will continue to implement other projects to ensure taps don’t run dry, including curtailing usage by reducing the water pressure and tapping underground aquifers, said Xanthea Limberg, the mayoral committee member for water and waste services.
“Although dam levels have improved, we need to be sure that we can safely navigate the summer of 2019 and this will only be possible once we know where we stand at the end of this winter rainfall season,” she said in an emailed response to questions.
The six main dams supplying Cape Town are at 39.1% of capacity, compared with 23% a year ago, the city said on its website on Tuesday.
At this stage in 2014, the dams were more than 90% full. While the authorities warned earlier this year that they may be forced to switch off the taps and residents would have to collect a daily ration from distribution points, that risk has abated.</p>
